    <h2>About</h2>
<p>I'm an entrepreneur-minded citizen graduated from a double master degree in management with the ESC Toulouse (France)
and the WFI Ingolstadt (Germany). Fueled by hope and indignation, I explore new technologies and the fast-evolving
social context to help new opportunities of change for the better to emerge.</p>
<p>I have thus a particular focus on P2P-economy, open and hack logics (open source/design/data, DIY…)
and their implementation in transformational entrepreneurship processes toward a society of greater capacity
of care, being an enthusiast reader of Bernard Stiegler’s and Ars Industrialis’s critics of our current system.</p>
<p>Those interests led me, in 2012, to write my master thesis on the <a href="paper-ethical-marketing">possibilities of
less destructive, less toxic marketing practicies</a>. My conclusion underlines <a href="paper-ethical-marketing/part-3#3-2">
the interest for citizen/consumers to invest Vendor Relationship Management (VRM) tools as an opportunty
to lower the asymetry in their relations with businesses.</a></p>
<p>In the following months, I digged further on the idea to start VRM from P2P-RM, that is <a href="p2p-rm">P2P Resources Management
tools</a>, peers having relations of trust that mainstream businesses could never dream of. I like to imagine that peers, exchanging
 under their rules, could reach a critical mass at which businesses would be force to follow comparable rules: symmetric
communication valuating trust, and, why not dreaming, generosity.

<h2>Getting serious</h2>
<p>Since Spring 2013, i took the plunge of seriously starting to learn web development, resulting in a sort of
full-stack web social entrepreneur profile or, being less arrogant, a guy with values, ideas and a clue.</p>
<p>I hope 2014 to be the year I publish a first prototype of this <a href="p2p-rm">P2P-RM system</a> thing.</p>
