<p>This project was born during the Startup Weekend Paris n&deg;2 in April 2011 and benefited from a warm welcome. Unfortunately, I had to put the project in standby for several reasons:<br /><br />- As I was in internship at that time, I could only work on BookSurfing as for a part-time project<br /><br />- A Startup Weekend give a momentum, not a coherent Human Ressource strategy<br /><br />- To be perfectly honest, my lack of experience at that time didn&rsquo;t help.<br /><br />When I will be able to gather better conditions for a successful launch, which are basically 1/ be freed from my management studies&rsquo; obligations 2/ find the right technical co-funder (ready for a full-time venture, social entrepreneurship &amp; collaborative consumption -passionate, looking for epicness) 3/ find the right fundings conditions that would fit the project spirit, I will reboot the project.</p>
