    <p><strong>2.1
        Foundation of Bernard Stiegler’s work: Indetermination of technique,
        pharmacology and organology</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In
      order to understand the critiques of marketing by Bernard Stiegler and Ars
      Industrialis – the association he founded in 2005 –, we have to immerse,
      as synthetically as possible, in the very foundations of his work,
      especially his understanding of technique given that marketing, as a human
      artifact, could be understood as a technique or a set of technical means.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Techniques
      - and thus marketing - have no essential determined goal: following
      Heidegger’s understanding of the human condition, the only certitude of
      existence is death; the human technical condition is thus an attempt to
      flight from death by the use of techniques in order to flight from the
      “original time” to the intra-temporal and inauthentic time: the time of
      technique and calculation, in an attempt to calculate the incalculable and
      undetermined to flight from the fundamental anxiety that is certitude of
      death (Barison &amp; Ross 2004). For Stiegler, “Man is nothing other than
      technical life” (Barison &amp; Ross 2004). Techniques are prosthesis of
      the human condition; forcing us – humans – to answer the question of who
      we are in order to determine the techniques we have to consider being our
      qualities. For Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe – also interviewed in Barison and
      Ross’s film<span>&nbsp;</span><em>The Ister</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>–, the question of ethics
      became infinitely problematic: in a society organized by the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>mythos</em>,
      the end of technique is given; technique (<em>techne</em>) and nature (<em>physis</em>)
      aren’t differentiated. On the other hand, in a society organized by the<span
       >&nbsp;</span><em>logos</em>, techniques
      are the mean to obtain what nature can’t provide, but there is no given
      end to this; ends are infinite and to determine. This problematic is even
      stronger after the belief in Progress of humanity through the progress of
      techniques has been a breath-taken following Death Camps in which the
      undetermined end of technique found its most shocking illustration.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Indeed,
      the material means employed for the Holocaust have been made available by
      the industrial revolution: the difference with the economic industrial
      activity is the end aimed. The problem is the same regarding marketing
      communication and war propaganda under a totalitarian regime: techniques
      gathered under those terms are similar – communication technologies
      articulated with behavior science aiming to influence or control minds –
      the difference is in the end aimed. For Stiegler after Plato, techniques
      are pharmacologic, which means that all techniques are ambivalent, both<span
       >&nbsp;</span><em>poison</em>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>remedy</em>.
      In his first and most famous book,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Techniques
        and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus</em><span>&nbsp;</span>(published
      in 1994 in French, 1998 in English) Stiegler use the myth of Prometheus to
      explain the<em>pharmakon</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that
      are techniques, symbolized by the fire - which also symbolize the divine
      power - stolen by Prometheus to the Gods and given to humans. Fire is
      vital to heat our houses and cook our meal, but can also burn the house.
      This ambivalence of techniques is the reason why there is a need of a
      system of care, a therapeutic: every technique has a healing power and a
      destructive power (Ars Industrialis 2010), from the technique of writing,
      as explained by Plato in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>The
        Phaedrus</em>, which allows reminding something but also allow feigning
      wisdom, to magnetic resonance imaging that can detect cancers or be used
      to determine human brain unconscious backdoors and implement this
      knowledge with increased sells in purpose.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Approaching
      marketing as a<span>&nbsp;</span><em>pharmakon</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>does not directly solved the
      problem of ethical marketing: we have to determine if, as a technique and
      thus a<span>&nbsp;</span><em>pharmakon,</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>marketing is ambivalent and
      free to be made good or bad use by practitioners or if, as a set of
      techniques organized toward a given end, marketing is already naming a
      policy, a techniques arrangement, in which techniques might be toxically
      organized. Unfortunately, during the time given to write the present
      paper, no writing has been found in Stiegler’s work that would suggest
      what would be a non-toxic, that is to say a benefic use of the technique
      called marketing or a beneficial use of the techniques arrangement called
      marketing. Is it because there is none? This seems to remain an open
      question in Stiegler’s works. Nevertheless, if marketing is the
      organization of relationships aiming profit as put by Camenisch (Camenisch
      1991), marketing already integrate a given end, that is to say it is not
      an undetermined technique but it already refer to a policy, a social
      organ, which articulate techniques toward a determined end, profit. The
      debate under this point is to determine, after Stiegler’s strong critique
      of marketing detailed hereafter, if marketing is essentially a toxic
      organization of social relations or if classic marketing policy are a
      toxically designed arrangement of marketing techniques but can be returned
      as a cure as any<span>&nbsp;</span><em>pharmakon</em>.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>What
      are the criteria allowing Stiegler to say that the use of a technique is
      good or bad, curative or toxic? It is its trend to extend desire
      capacities of the individual – desire understood in its Freudian or
      Lacanian meaning – and intensify what Simondon calls the psychic and
      collective individuation process. Symmetrically, the toxic pole of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>pharmaka</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>creates what Marx called
      alienation, and what Stiegler after Freud call the destruction of the
      social energy that is the libido, or after Simondon, the desindividuation
      process (Stiegler 2012a).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>2.2.1
      Freud’s core concept: the libidinal economy</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In
      the Freudian vision of the psychic system, the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>libidinal
        economy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is the
      process by which the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>psychic
        energy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that are<span
       >&nbsp;</span><em>drives</em><span>&nbsp;</span>are
      transformed in a<span>&nbsp;</span><em>social
        energy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that is<span
       >&nbsp;</span><em>desire</em><span>&nbsp;</span>(Stiegler
      2008b, p.72) through the process of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>sublimation</em>:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>Desire
        is not only opposed to sideration, it is also opposed to the drive – or
        more exactly it is what trans-forme the drive: what sublime it.
        Sublimation is the constituent process by which humanity, as
        transformation from drives into desires, lead hominization as a trend
        for the individual elevation that Aristotle qualified as noetic
        (intellectual and spiritual)”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Ars
        Industrialis 2012a)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For
      Freud, the term of libido names the energy of drives, to which we usually
      refer to as “love”, which gathers</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>self-love,
        and on the other, love for parents and children, friendship and love for
        humanity in general, and also devotion to concrete objects and to
        abstract ideas.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Freud
        1949)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Stiegler
      underlines the proximity of this definition of libido with Aristotle’s
      concept of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>philia</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>that is a “centripetal social
      energy” (Stiegler 2008b, p.134). The concept of libidinal economy points
      the system by which the psychic energy that are drives – and among them
      sexual drives but not only – is economized and invested, canalized toward
      objects of love or of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>attention</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>– that is both a capacity of
      caring and a capacity of being attentive (Ars Industrialis 2012b):</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>Any
        society is based on a libidinal economy transforming the satisfaction of
        drives, that are in essence asocial, in a social act”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Ars
        Industrialis 2012b)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      major critique formulated by Stiegler toward marketing is due to what
      Stiegler describe as an attempt to divert the libidinal energy for the
      profit of products sold, thus short-circuiting the process of sublimation
      and leading to the destruction of desire. This diversion is made through
      the industrialized use of psycho-technologies by program industries –
      television and radio – theorized since the beginning of marketing research
      through the study of means to address the preconscious and unconscious
      layer of the psychic apparatus rather than to simply address the
      consciousness of individuals. Those developments made and still make an
      extensive use of Freud’s breakthrough in psychology as detailed hereafter,
      making Stiegler consider that, after the industrial revolutions of the
      nineteenth and early twentieth century relying on carbon energy – coal and
      oil – the strategic energy leading economic developments during the second
      half of the twentieth century in the capitalist world was the libidinal
      energy – as it became the most strategic resource regarding economy of
      scale development – through the process of motivation’s production and
      canalization at an industrial scale by marketing toward merchandises,
      following Bernays, Cheskin and Dichter’s works on behavioral science
      applied to consumer motivation (Stiegler 2010a).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>2.2.2Freud’s
      American nephew: Edward Bernays</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>2.2.2.1The
      birth of Public Relations</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>At
      the beginning of the twentieth century, Sigmund Freud attempted to
      describe the human psychology and especially the articulation between
      conscious and unconscious functions. Following this breakthrough in the
      understanding of the human psychology, Freud’s nephew, Edward Bernays,
      born in 1891 in Vienna before his family moved to New York City in 1892,
      used both his uncle works and fame to contribute to the early days of
      Public Relations. His first act in the field of Public Relations was his
      contribution to the US federal government’s campaign made by the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Creel
        Commission</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to bring
      the American opinion around regarding the need to join the war effort in
      1917, despite the popular opposition (Adam Curtis 2002): his great
      accomplishment was to convince the government to use propaganda to address
      directly the opinion unconsciousness (Stiegler 2010a). After the end of
      World War I, Bernays start to work on Public Relations for businesses. His
      work for the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>American
        Tobacco Company</em><span>&nbsp;</span>led
      to what Bernays considered as the cigarettes market doubling by spinning
      the public opinion on the product sold by his client (Dumas et al. 2012).
      In the early 1920s, smoking women were considered vulgar; Bernays
      successfully changed this by making<span>&nbsp;</span><em>suffragettes</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>publicly smoke in front of
      the press. The picture of those feminist activists smoking as a symbol of
      their independency, widely relayed by the US Medias, would be the start of
      a new era for the tobacco industry. Presenting cigarettes as “torches of
      freedom” – a name normally associated with the Statue of Liberty – and
      theorizing them as phallic symbol, recalling to the masculine domination –
      an analysis that isn’t without controversy but that is out of our present
      subject – and thus to independency was a very direct application of
      Freud’s theory of the unconscious by Bernays. This action of opinion
      “spinning” inaugurated later in the twentieth century the occupation of
      “spinning doctor”, for which Bernays is considered being the founding
      father (Tye 1998). As put by Bernays’s biographist, his revolutionary
      contribution was to sell a product not by finding customers that have a
      behavioral compatibility with the product but rather to attempt to shape
      their behavior, their way of life in order to make it fit the product:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>Bernays’s
        tactic differed, but his philosophy in each case was the same. Hired to
        sell a product or a service, he instead sold whole new ways of behaving,
        which appeared obscure but over time reaped huge rewards for his clients
        and redefined the very texture of American life.”</em><span><span>&nbsp;</span>(McLaughlin
        &amp; Parry 2006, p.9)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>2.2.2.2“Without
      mind control to minimize cleavages, democracy would be chaos”</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      psychological approach that Bernays wanted to implement at an industrial
      scale to model behaviors, associated with Medias’ broadcasting power led
      to the reappropriation of the term Proganda through his eponym book<em><span
         >&nbsp;</span>Propaganda</em>. At that
      time, the term propaganda didn’t had such a negative connotation as after
      World War II and Goebbels’ Minister of Propaganda, which was inspired by
      Bernays’ works (Chomsky 1997; Stauber &amp; Rampton 1999). In this book,
      Bernays describe his vision of democracy and how elite have to organize
      the potential chaos:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>The
        conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and
        opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.
        Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an
        invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We
        are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas
        suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical
        result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast
        numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to
        live together as a smoothly functioning society.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Bernays
        1928, chap.I)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      justification of manipulation by this “invisible government” is said to be
      the unity of the society in a context of diverging influences, with
      “smoothness” on target.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>As
        civilization has become more complex, and as the need for invisible
        government has been increasingly demonstrated, the technical means have
        been invented and developed by which opinion may be regimented. With the
        printing press and the newspaper, the railroad, the telephone,
        telegraph, radio and airplanes, ideas can be spread rapidly and even
        instantaneously over the whole of America.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Bernays
        1928, chap.I)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      manipulative approach of politics leads to a comparable strategy in the
      field of commercial exchanges, which is also justified by the higher good
      of society at large:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>In
        theory, everybody buys the best and cheapest commodities offered him on
        the market. In practice, if everyone went around pricing, and chemically
        testing before purchasing, the dozens of soaps or fabrics or brands of
        bread which are for sale, economic life would become hopelessly jammed.
        To avoid such confusion, society consents to have its choice narrowed to
        ideas and objects brought to its attention through propaganda of all
        kinds. There is consequently a vast and continuous effort going on to
        capture our minds in the interest of some policy or commodity or idea.”<span
         >&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Bernays 1928,
        chap.I)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Here,
      the effort of propaganda is not only justified by the impossibility to get
      product information otherwise, but also to capture and canalize mind in a
      predefined direction, the direction chosen by the “invisible government”.
      For this purpose, Bernays sees no restriction in matter of communication
      means:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em><span><span>There
            is no means of human communication which may not also be a means of
            deliberate propaganda, because propaganda is simply the establishing
            of reciprocal understanding between an individual and a group.”</span></span><span
         >&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Bernays 1928,
        chap.XI)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      idealized vision of propaganda as a mean for an invisible government to
      keep society united has been contested and analyzed, only a few decades
      later, as a major threat to democracy: Alex Carey opened the way for Noam
      Chomsky by pointing “the growth of corporate propaganda as a means of
      protecting corporate power against democracy” and thus considering that it
      has been one of the major political developments of the twentieth century
      (Carey 1996, p.18). Justifying propaganda, that is to say conscious
      efforts to manipulate opinions unconsciousness, for the sake of a national
      interest already seems ethically contestable; doing so for the sake of
      private profits is even more and – without speaking of individuation
      process – constitute an attack toward one of the classical microeconomic
      theory pillar that is the rational<span>&nbsp;</span><em>homo
        oeconomicus</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as
      detailed later. This marketing ancestor that are public relations put here
      a huge step in the political matters with thus a social impact obviously
      superior to the sole economic circuit on which economic theorists such as
      Friedman want to focus:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>I
        share Adam Smith's skepticism about the benefits that can be expected
        from "those who affected to trade for the public good"–this argument
        must be rejected on grounds of principle. What it amounts to is an
        assertion that those who favor the taxes and expenditures in question
        have failed to persuade a majority of their fellow citizens to be of
        like mind and that they are seeking to attain by undemocratic procedures
        what they cannot attain by democratic procedures.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Friedman
        1970)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Friedman’s
      blindness regarding the social impact of the economic activity, the
      obvious permeability between managerial, economic and politic matters,
      echoes especially wrong when put aside with Bernays theory of the
      “invisible government” that are governments and corporations through
      propaganda: if propaganda is in charge of societies destiny through the
      dissimulated drive of democratic procedures that are attempts of mind
      control, the same pseudo-democratic procedures would hardly be said
      autonomously responsible of the public good. Friedman puts a virtual fence
      between economic activities and society, leading to a full
      deresponsibilisation of businesses. However, marketing and business at
      large can’t be a neutral practice restrained to a virtually isolated
      sphere of society, especially since the raise of multinational
      corporations as borderless independent entities: business and marketing
      design are<span>&nbsp;</span><em>de facto<span
         >&nbsp;</span></em>a political act in the
      sense that they have a huge impact on the shape of the social
      organization. While denied by business professionals following the
      Friedmanian conception of business, this point is strengthened by the
      Social Business approach, which aims to have a positive impact on society
      by other means than the sole GDP augmentation. Bernays’ approach of
      propaganda has not yet been affected by the technicist blindness and put
      that the ethical responsibility toward society shall be borne by the
      practitioner:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>Propaganda
        becomes vicious and reprehensive only when its authors consciously and
        deliberately disseminate what they know to be lies, or when they aim at
        effects which they know to be prejudicial to the common good.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Bernays
        1928, chap.II)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>But
      this concern for the common good is largely subordinated under the
      powerful interest of Public Relations, which through successive attempts
      to make consumers behavior fit the interest of Public Relations’ clients
      constitute a societal project toward consumerism. As Paul Mazur, the
      former associate of Bernays (Stiegler 2010a) and a Lehman Brothers’
      employee in the 1930s, said:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>"We
        must shift America from a needs- to a desires-culture. People must be
        trained to desire, to want new things, even before the old have been
        entirely consumed.<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>[...]</span><em><span
         >&nbsp;</span>Man's desires must
        overshadow his needs"<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Adam
        Curtis 2002)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      statement became a tangible reality since the 1950-1960s and the early
      days of the modern American Way of Life as a consumerist lifestyle,
      valuating possessions and an endless innovation for the sake of novelty,
      opening an era of accelerated obsolescence of goods and higher waste
      (Stiegler 2010a), in which, despite a lower media coverage, Motivation
      Research rose and prospered among practitioners, beside quantitative
      approaches of marketing (Fullerton 2011, p.67).</p>

    <h3>2.2.3<span><span><span><span><span>From
                a scientific approach of propaganda to the birth of modern
                marketing: the science of motivation</span></span></span></span></span></h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span><span><span>If
            rationalized attempts of crowd manipulation is something that can be
            found earlier in East or West history through the empirical works of
            Han Fei Zi or Machiavelli for instance, Bernays attempt to build a
            scientific expertise on propaganda by implementing Freud’s work on
            the unconscious combined with the emerging mass communication
            channels that are the press and the radio in 1920s - and that will
            soon be the cinema and the television - creates an unprecedented
            mass manipulation paradigm, methodically maximizing the use of
            available scientific knowledge toward a better understanding and
            stimulation of motives. Among other,<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span>Ernest
      Dichter and Louis Cheskin,<span>&nbsp;</span><span><span><span>following
            Bernays’ work,</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>pushed
      forward the use of psychology for the purpose of systematically analyzing
      markets and developed the field of Motivation Research. Those research on
      how to “stimulate” buyers were the answer to a new problem of the
      after-World War II era, in which production was not the problem anymore,
      rather was avoiding the risk of overproduction as it occurred in the
      1920-1930’s by selling more than what consumers really “need”, which is
      morally justified by the imperative of avoiding the economic depression
      (Stiegler 2008c, pp.235–237; Packard 1957, p.43). This scientific approach
      of motivation through the study of psychology discoveries on preconscious
      and unconscious dimensions of the mind went, especially after 1950, with a
      greater integration with other behavioral sciences “sociology and
      anthropology and even in some areas of economics”, with the purpose to
      answer the question “why does a consumer buy or not buy a product”
      (Fullerton 2011, p.62). This unprecedented scientific approach of motives
      evolves during the second half of the twentieth century and spread from
      the US to the rest of Western societies after the 1970s (Stiegler 2008c,
      p.231).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>2.2.4Problems
      inherent to marketing’s scientific approach of its influence on behaviors:
      playing with the system limits</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      discipline that emerged under the name of marketing, aims science rigor
      and status – as economics before it – despite the limits inherent to soft
      sciences, and is</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>profoundly
        dominated by the empiricist world view and the logical empiricist
        paradigm”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Arndt
        1985)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>could
      in the end be defined as the science of creating and canalizing motivation
      in the absence of physical coercion and within a cultural and legal
      framework of limits framing the acceptable possibilities of psychological
      influences, a pragmatic approach of motivation of another within the
      cultural and legal framework of a “freedom society” as shaped after the
      Enlightments in the eighteenth century. This cultural and legal limits
      being social constructions, the aimed scientific rigor faces a challenge:
      maximizing efficiency in motives production with a scientific approach
      necessarily means playing with the limits of the system, and – when at
      reach – influence those limits. This possible influence on limits of the
      system in which the discipline develops its knowledge and rules is a major
      difference with hard sciences. Marketing’s dependency toward social
      sciences – especially psychology and sociology – has been hence
      progressively minimized toward the hard science that is neurology, in a
      move comparable to the one leading economists to mathematize economics for
      the sake of being more scientific: if marketing’s early developments
      through social sciences are still omnipresent, it has since been completed
      with a more neurologic approach and the development of tools such as
      offline and online eye-tracking or neuromarketing, pushing further
      consumer behavior understanding and thus possibilities to influence on
      consumer behavior (Morin 2011).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      above definition of marketing highlights the two main battlefields that
      are “what are acceptable psychological influences?” from a legal point of
      view – in which the state legislative power is subject to lobbies
      pressures – and from a cultural point of view – in which culture is
      subject to propaganda efforts to shape society through psychopower (cf<span
       >&nbsp;</span><em>infra</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Biopower
      and psychopower). There is here a possible self-strengthening circle in
      which propaganda efforts to influence culturally acceptable practices
      would strengthen lobbying initiatives toward a more<span>&nbsp;</span><em>laissez-faire</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>legislation on industrialized
      psychological influences – of psychopower – which would give more liberty
      to, again, influence culture. A side effect is that attempting to model
      the culture would – if successful – influences the metastabilization (cf<span
       >&nbsp;</span><em>infra</em><span>&nbsp;</span>The
      Simondonian psychic apparatus genesis) of new knowledge in marketing
      studies, as students would be culturally more open to those development
      and would, once in charge, be more assertive, playing with further pushed
      limits. The final limit of such a vicious circle is what Stiegler calls a<span
       >&nbsp;</span><em>catastrophè</em>: the
      denouement of a trend, which when playing with its limits become more
      visible and open the possibility of a system crisis that is a moment of
      change possibilities. The major limit that Stiegler analyze as being the
      base of the current<em>catastrophè</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is
      what he calls the symbolic misery (Stiegler 2005).</p>

    <h3>2.2.5The
      Birth of Consumer Behavior and consumerism</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>2.2.5.1From
      Consumerism to mass consumerism</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>From
      an historical point of view, putting a unique and simple definition to
      consumerism is a difficult task, as underlined by Trentmann, due to “the
      abundance of choice and the semiotic and, indeed, political implications
      of any particular approach” (Trentmann 2004). In<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Consumerism
        in World History: The Global Transformation of Desire</em>, Stearns
      defined consumerism as “the lure of material goods”. The term consumerism</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>describes
        a society in which many people formulate their goals in life partly
        through acquiring goods that they clearly do not need for subsistence or
        for traditional display”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Trentmann
        2004)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>,
      which “first emerged in eighteenth-century Western Europe, and from there
      was exported to the rest of the globe”. In this societal shift of
      consumerism, marketing techniques may have been playing the role of the<span
       >&nbsp;</span><em>pharmakos</em><span>&nbsp;</span>–
      the scapegoat – among possibly hasty critiques nowadays, rather than the<span
       >&nbsp;</span><em>pharmakon</em><span>&nbsp;</span>responsible
      of this shift: the consumerism trend as well as the individualism trend is
      historically anterior to modern marketing techniques. Nevertheless, the
      society analyzed by Marcuse in the 1950s in his book<span>&nbsp;</span><em>The
        One-Dimensional Man</em><span>&nbsp;</span>refers
      to a different society associated with the notion of “mass consumer
      society” (Trentmann 2004). After 1945, mass consumerism, that is to say
      consumerism extended to middle and lower classes, is propelled by
      post-World War II reconstruction but its basement relies on the new
      economical paradigm of wages inaugurated a few decades earlier by Henry
      Ford, raising workers’ wages above the subsistence wage, once analyzed by
      Lassalle and later by Marx and Engels as the “Iron law of wages”.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>The
        scale of their living – the rate of their wages – determines the
        prosperity of the country.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Ford
        &amp; Crowther 1922, chap.VIII)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Fordism
      more generous wage paradigm – which, before the “our employees are our
      customer” idea, had the great advantage to magnet the best talents of
      Detroit and limit the huge staff turnover created by the implementation of
      the Taylorist Scientific Management – unlocked the possibility for masses
      to tend toward a consumption behavior comparable to the one of the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>bourgeoisie,<span
         >&nbsp;</span></em>beyond the material
      necessity, pictured through the “American Way of Life” (Stiegler 2010a).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>"Our
        enormously productive economy</em><span><span>&nbsp;</span>[...]<span
         >&nbsp;</span></span><em>demands that we
        make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of
        goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction, our ego
        satisfaction, in consumption<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>[...]<span
         >&nbsp;</span></span><em>we need things
        consumed, burned up, replaced and discarded at an ever-accelerating
        rate."<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Lebow
        1955)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>But
      aside from Fordism mass production and high wages policy, Stiegler points
      another pillar to the cultural shift toward a mass consumerism society
      that is cultural industries: the cinema through the fast-developing
      neighborhood of Hollywood in the 1910s, the radio with the Radio
      Corporation of America (RCA) and soon television would broadcast the
      sounds and the images of this emerging culture (Stiegler 2010a). At the
      same time, advertising knows a tremendous development, raising from a
      volume of “about $200 million in 1880 to nearly $3 billion in 1920” (Pope
      2003, p.2).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>While
        advertising generated modern anxieties about its social and ethical
        implications, it nevertheless acquired a new centrality in the 1920s.
        Consumer spending–fueled in part by the increased availability of
        consumer credit–on automobiles, radios, household appliances, and
        leisure time activities like spectator sports and movie going paced a
        generally prosperous 1920s. Advertising promoted these products and
        services. The rise of mass circulation magazines, radio broadcasting and
        to a lesser extent motion pictures provided new media for advertisements
        to reach consumers.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Pope
        2003, p.3)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Those
      developments of psychotechnologies, as defined and analyzed hereafter,
      offer a favorable context to the development of Public Relations as
      theorized and put into practice by Bernays and to the development of
      advertising industry, with the support of public authorities as
      illustrated by this 1926 speech of the US President Calvin Coolidge, in
      which he pronounced a benediction on the business of advertising:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>Advertising
        ministers to the spiritual side of trade. It is a great power that has
        been intrusted to your keeping which charges you with the high
        responsibility of inspiring and ennobling the commercial world. It is
        all part of the greater work of regeneration and redemption of mankind.”</em><span><span
         >&nbsp;</span>(Pope 2003, p.3)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      promotion of the marketing tool that is advertising is part of what could
      be called the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>meta-propaganda</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>of consumerism.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Public
      relation and advertising, as the exploitation of the new
      psychotechnologies that are analogical writing technologies produced by
      the machinist turn of sensitivity for a merchant use, are the tools of
      what Stiegler calls a psychopower.</p>

    <h3>2.3.1The
      Simondonian psychic apparatus genesis: psychic and collective
      individuation</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A
      first-hand reading of Stiegler’s writing is, here especially, recommended
      in order to fully perceive the complexity of Stiegler’s conceptual
      framework. Stiegler’s use and extend Simondon’s work on the technique,
      psychic and collective individuation. Simondon’s thinking</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>is
        really systemic, what makes the reading<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>[and
        interpretation]</span><em><span>&nbsp;</span>complex.
        Every notion shore up the others, which over-determine the first one in
        return.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Salzmann
        1994, p.7)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A
      first-hand reading of Simondon is thus also a non-negligible investment to
      fully understand the notions hereafter that would require a higher level
      of detail than what is possible here. Simondon conceptualizes
      individuation as a<span>&nbsp;</span><em>transductive
        relation</em>: a relation in which the technical, psychical or
      collective individual’s inside and outside are not in an opposition
      relation but rather compose together (Stiegler 2008b, p.99):</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>The
        relation between the individual and the transindividual define itself as
        what go beyond the individual while prolonging it: the transindividual
        is not outside from the individual but nonetheless detach itself to a
        certain extent from the individual</em><span>.[…]</span><em>The
        psychological individuality appears as what develop itself while
        developing the transindividuality; this elaboration in based on two
        related dialectics, the one that interiorize the outside, the other that
        exteriorize the inside”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Simondon
        1989, p.156)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A
      psychological individual is thus not the “fully constituted” result being
      determined by an external system but is “the<em><span>&nbsp;</span>element<span
         >&nbsp;</span></em>[milieu] of
      individuation.”(Deleuze 2001, p.43). The psychic individual never is, but
      is always becoming, that is to say is always in this individuation
      process. He is thus permanently being determined by the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>metastable
        system</em><span>&nbsp;</span>– a system
      of relative stability, a balance between two transformations (Salzmann
      1994, p.6) – he is part of and being determining this outside<span>&nbsp;</span><em>milieu</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>he exercises his forces in.
      This transductive relation that is individuation is illustrated by the
      example of the brick becoming, that is going through the process of the
      technical individuation of a brick by the composition of forces in a
      metastable system, the mould being informing the clay whose pre-individual
      or pre-formation properties – its material properties, its inner
      heterogeneity etc. – inform the matter (Stiegler 2008b, p.98; Salzmann
      1994, pp.6–10). An illustration of this transductive relation could be
      made through the development of the collective individual that is a
      language: the linguistic development is the collective stabilization of
      the technical objects that are words and their organizational rules that
      are grammar and syntaxes, which becomes the pre-existent, the
      pre-individual base of psychic individuals. In order to be adopted and to
      determine the individuation of a psychic individual, the language has to
      be receipted from another individual first, but will be truly adopted when
      re-emitted that is to say when the psychic individual is able to take the
      long circuit that is taking part in the collective individuation and to
      transform this milieu. That is also what is happening in the stabilization
      of academic knowledge in universities: the student will receive anterior
      knowledge developments of his field and this stabilized knowledge will
      constitute the basis of his work as researcher, by which he will be able
      to criticize and prolong previous developments of his research field and
      thus to aim to stabilize new knowledge, that is to transform the
      collective individual that is his field. This mutually transformative
      relation between the metastabilized milieu and psychic and collective
      individuals is the process of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>transindividuation</em>.
      This fundamental aspect of the psychic individuation as an essentially
      collective and participative movement, producing not only individuals but
      also a milieu, is a major key to the pharmacological critique of hereafter
      described uni-directionnal psycho-technologies – TV, cinema, radio – in
      which mass of individuals only receive information but never participate
      and transform the milieu, and thus doesn’t individuate themselves but
      rather desindividuate.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      participation to the milieu transformation, the participation to its
      individuation that is transindividuation, is in the case of knowledge what
      make the difference between knowledge and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>savoirs</em>:
      you can have a lot of knowledge and even be able to repeat it but if you
      don’t try to transform it, that is to say to make the long circuit of
      thinking in order to be able to criticize it, you experience a
      short-circuit, you are not individualizing yourself as the meanings
      created are superficial and make you unable to use this knowledge in
      another way than automated: I’m told that I will have marketing
      responsibilities in a firm, I will have to put pressure for lower costs
      and higher selling price. But if I never had to do the long circuit of the
      thinking leading to this conclusion, if I have no meaningful historical or
      sociological background to help me understand why maximizing profits is or
      has been justified, I have no capacity to criticize it and this social
      function executed as a human automate has no taste: I don’t see the
      profound reasons of my actions and I’m not able to see the consequences of
      it. I have no grip to properly understand that reality and thus can’t
      develop an autonomous thinking of it: I’m not a major person in the
      Kantian understanding of majority [<em>Mündigkeit</em>].</p>

    <h3>2.3.2Powers
      upon individuals</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      metastable system can be influenced by attempts to shape it through
      intelligently designed forces, constituting powers, which produce an
      energy shaping this milieu made of transductive relations. This are
      biopower – power to constraint one’s body –, psychopower – power to
      influence one’s psychology –, neuropower – power to stimulate one’s
      neurological functions.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>2.3.2.1Biopower
      and psychopower</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In
      his book<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Taking Care
        of Youth and the Generations</em><span>&nbsp;</span>(2008),
      Bernard Stiegler describes attempts toward a mind control power through
      the term of p<em>sycho-power</em>, in analogy with Michel Foucault’s
      concept of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>bio-power.</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>If biopower is</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>an
        explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the
        subjugations of bodies and the control of populations”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Foucault
        1979, p.140)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>used
      by states and their polices, making up a<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Disciplinary
        Society</em><span>&nbsp;</span>controlling
      bodies through environments of enclosure – prison, hospital, factory,
      school, family, army –, Stiegler, after Foucault and Deleuze, define the
      psychopower as the use of psychotechniques allowing what Deleuze describe
      as a<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Society of
        Control<span>&nbsp;</span></em>(Stiegler
      2008c, p.32; Deleuze 1990).Biopower’s discipline is not the dominant power
      anymore, rather is Psychopower’s<span>&nbsp;</span><em>modulation</em>,
      an idea illustrated for states by the trend “to tax rather than to
      organize production” (Deleuze 1990, sec.I):</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>The
        conquests of the market are made by grabbing control and no longer by
        disciplinary training, by fixing the exchange rate much more than by
        lowering costs, by transformation of the product more than by
        specialization of production.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Deleuze
        1990, sec.II)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      downfall of discipline as the major organization principle is also the
      crisis of biopower enclosure institutions:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>We
        are in a generalized crisis in relation to all the environments of
        enclosure –prison, hospital, factory, school, family. The family is an
        "interior," in crisis like all other interiors<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>[…]<span
         >&nbsp;</span></span><em>The
        administrations in charge never cease announcing supposedly necessary
        reforms: to reform schools, to reform industries, hospitals, the armed
        forces, prisons. But everyone knows that these institutions are
        finished, whatever the length of their expiration periods”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Deleuze
        1990, chap.I)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      supposedly irreversible downfall of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>interiors</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>that are family and school
      has important consequences on individuals’ learning process of
      responsibility, analyzed by Stiegler in the hereafter described relation
      of forces between family, the program institution that is school and the
      program industry that is television. The role of marketing in the society
      of control is central: marketing is the external broadcasting limb of the
      corporation spirit, when management is the internal one.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>Marketing
        has become the center or the "soul" of the corporation. We are taught
        that corporations have a soul, which is the most terrifying news in the
        world. The operation of markets is now the instrument of social control
        and forms the impudent breed of our masters.”</em><span><span>&nbsp;</span>(Deleuze
        1990, chap.II)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      intuition of Deleuze toward the growing role of marketing as a spiritual
      institution rejoin the previously used meta-propaganda terminology: mass
      consumerism is made possible by the convergent signals, from the dominant
      culture in the society at large and from the market and the professional
      activity through marketing and management, in such a way that an psychic
      individuate individuating in those milieu tend to conform, that is to
      coindividuate and enhance this trend in the transindividual milieu. This
      psychopower approach of marketing has been deepen to demonstrate this
      “remote control of behaviours and representations” and how</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>it
        has become the prevailing symbolic form structured by the present
        imaginary significations of the neo liberal capitalism (or its new
        spirit), thus structuring the symbolic relationships in today’s
        societies</em><span>[, which]</span><em><span>&nbsp;</span>has
        been greatly made possible by the emergence of a new type of
        psychological individuality with narcissistic trends which is an
        appropriate target for the invasion of goods.”</em><span>(Floris &amp;
        Ledun 2005)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      egg-and-chicken problem we meet here between the tools of consumerism
      propaganda and individualist consumerist behaviors is characteristic of
      this technic, psychic and collective individuation in which trends compose
      together and, when convergent, reinforce each other. But this
      self-sustaining trend of converging signals doesn’t come without limits.
      Lordon, commenting this 1990 text of Deleuze, highlights the current trend
      of management, especially in the US, to promote the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>management
        of fun</em>, what Lordon but also the British magazine<span>&nbsp;</span><em>The
        Economist</em><span>&nbsp;</span>describe
      as a deleterious attempt to hide a major issue for employees motivation:
      the lack of meaning in their daily tasks (Lordon 2010; The Economist
      2010). Those limits are at the heart of Stiegler’s criticism regarding the
      destruction of attention and desire capacities:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>Psycho-power
        is the systematic organisation of the capture of attention made possible
        by the psycho-technologies that have developed with the radio (1920),
        with television (1950) and with digital technologies (1990), spreading
        all over the planet through various forms of networks, and resulting in
        a constant industrial canalization of attention which has provoked
        recently a massive phenomenon of the destruction of this attention that
        American nosologists call attention deficit disorder. This destruction
        of attention is a particular case, and especially serious one, of the
        destruction of libidinal energy whereby the capitalist libidinal economy
        self-destructs.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Stiegler
        2008d)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Without
      being the result of a<span>&nbsp;</span><em>plot
        theory</em><span>&nbsp;</span>or anything
      of this kind, such a stressing of the influence of marketing, its power
      upon our lives, is actually very common:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>While
        the idea of actual ‘mind control’ may seem far-fetched and unrealistic,
        the fact remains that the marketing industry has had a firm grasp over
        the American perception<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>[and
        by extension the one of Western societies, and growingly from every
        industrialized societies]<span>&nbsp;</span></span><em>of
        everything from smoking to sex education.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Phan
        2010, p.4)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>2.3.2.2Neuropower</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>By
      extension of the psychopower,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>neuro-power</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>doesn’t even aim one’s
      psychology; there is here no attempt to influence the unconscious but
      rather to directly stimulate the brain neurologic apparatus. That is the
      realm of neuromarketing developments, this field of marketing interested
      in neurotechniques in a state of accelerated development since the early
      2000s (Morin 2011) but to which could be connected older practices.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Each
      power is a field of intelligent ruse –<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Metis</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>– developments for a human
      being or a human organization wanting to control other human being:
      biopower had the concept of panopticon, originally a kind of prison
      organized in a way that every individuals was self-disciplining by fear
      and ignorance of if he was being seen or not, extensively analyzed by
      Foucault and analyzed since in other institutions such as the management
      of call-centers (Bain &amp; Taylor 2000) but impossible, as a biopower, to
      be used by marketing. Marketing focuses thus on psychotechnical and
      neurotechnical ruses: psychopower is the realm of psychological ruse
      through symbolic constructions, extensively used through advertisement
      techniques to associate a product and an idea – Redbull and extreme
      life-experience through the sponsoring of X-sport demonstration for
      instance – and are thus at the heart of the diverting disposal of psychic
      energy aiming the production of a motivation. Neurotechniques have allowed
      the recent development of neuromarketing through “the use of technology
      and knowledge coming from the field of cognitive neuroscience” focusing on
      the process of attention capture and the creation of an appropriated
      emotional context in order to make the advertisement more efficient (Morin
      2011, p.132): the emblematic practice of this neuromarketing definition is
      the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) – currently “the
      most popular [method] amongst marketing companies” (Phan 2010, p.4) –
      techniques with the purpose of identifying areas of the brain that are
      stimulated by a given message, an image or even a smell in order to
      precise the marketing means that fit the most the identity of a brand
      without “requiring demanding cognitive or conscious participation” of
      tested customers (Morin 2011, p.131). However, beyond this focus on
      attention capture mechanism, the neuromarketing definition could also be
      connected to the researches and practices on customers retention through a
      better understanding of addictions: Coca Cola’s high sugar rate or Tobacco
      industry’s use of nicotine are clearly more on the side of neurotechniques
      than psychotechniques; compulsive shopping, which once understood is a
      tremendous marketing lever is also studied in terms of addiction (Hartston
      2012). Those research on neuromarketing constitute the latest avatar of
      Cheskin’s and Dichter’s science of motivation with a focus on the brain
      reward system</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>a
        set of very old brain regions from an evolutionary point of view. This
        system makes emotion and decision-making interact in a way that the last
        one escapes from pure rationality”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Dumas
        et al. 2012)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>However,
      the development of attention capture techniques could be attached to both
      the realm of psychotechniques and neurotechniques as the mechanism of
      attention capture encompass the studies of how to catch the attention of
      the neurologic apparatus – hence the higher volume of TV ads, the lobbying
      efforts defending outdoor advertising in motion (Dumas et al. 2012) etc. –
      and of how to stimulate the catched attention and keep it along the
      message with symbolically appropriated contents. The border is here tiny:
      how to class the use of erotic contents for instance that catch the
      attention by both symbolic and neurologic means? Such a systematic use of
      customer’s mind backdoors raises naturally important questions of ethics
      (Dumas et al. 2012).</p>

    <h3>2.3.3<em>Esprit</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>capacities and
      psychotechniques</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>2.3.3.1Memory
      and attention</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em><span><span>A
            psycho-technique is literally a technique on or from the<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>esprit</span></span><span><span>”<span
             >&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><span>(Ars
        Industrialis 2012c)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      French word<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Esprit</em>,
      as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Geist</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
      German, should here be understood as both the spirit and the mind, as a
      translation of the Ancient Greek<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Noùs</em>.
      As such, psychotechniques are the indispensable mean of human
      relationships: thinking and communication through speaking are the first
      bricks of human social developments as highlighted by anthropologic and
      linguistic researches (MacWhinney 2005). Those human mind capacities are
      made possible by the human brain memory capacity, allowing him to remind
      an experience, leading to the development of the brain as an intellectual
      organ, an organ able to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>inter-ligere</em>,
      to link together different elements, which will give the intelligence
      capacity.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      memory could be divided between what Husserl defines as primary and
      secondary<span>&nbsp;</span><em>retentions</em>.
      Primary retentions constitute the memory of events that are present, what
      allow ones for instance to keep in mind the beginning of a phrase –
      already in the past – to which will be articulated the presently added
      words. Those primary retentions are conditioned by secondary retentions,
      which constitute the memory of the past of an attentive consciousness,
      allowing one’s to tie the present with the past experience and to project<span
       >&nbsp;</span><em>protentions</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that
      are expectation determined by secondary retentions (Stiegler 2008c, p.38).
      For instance, once heard and assimilated, words are stored as a secondary
      retention, allowing one’s to understand a speech by reminding the
      previously understood words that constitute this speech.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Psychotechniques
      of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>re-tentions</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>pro-tentions</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>shape the capacity of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>at-tention</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>that is the very basis of the
      social communications: without this capacity of the mind to articulate
      retentions and protentions, there is no experience possible: “attention is
      the flow of consciousness” (Stiegler 2008c, p.38).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>2.3.3.2Grammatization
      and writing</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      human specificity regarding this psychic apparatus is techniques (Barison
      &amp; Ross 2004). Psychotechniques allows humans to outdo the brain
      memory: languages and their words allow the transmission of the
      individually accumulated experience: speech thus constitutes the beginning
      of cultures, a milieu shaped by past experiences accumulated and
      transmitted through the development of the language. Psychotechniques such
      as languages and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>savoirs-vivre</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>– sometime translated as the
      know-how-to-live-well, the expertise in living producing meanings
      constitutive of a culture i.e. an organization of the care –, constitute a
      preindividual milieu – for instance the linguistic milieu – in which
      psychic individuals become who they are, i.e. individuate: this is an
      illustration of how psychotechniques – but also other kind of techniques –
      overdetermine the process of individuation. However techniques also allow
      the memory to be stored on supports outside the neurologic system and thus
      form what Stiegler calls<span>&nbsp;</span><em>tertiary
        retentions</em>: this is the process of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>grammatization</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>of the mind, a concept
      designating “the passage from temporal continuous to spatial discrete”
      that is the exteriorization process of writing (Ars Industrialis 2012d).
      Through the grammatization process, the memory finds an external support
      to its transmission and accumulation and is thus extended and, again,
      overdetermined by the technical milieu. This overdetermination of the
      primary and secondary retentions by techniques, i.e. the technical milieu
      in which one’s individuate, is the reason why psychotechniques and their
      mechanization and industrialization as psychotechnology have a power of
      control, through the intelligent use of this overdetermination.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>2.3.3.3Psychotechnology</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      psychotechnique of writing, analyzed by Platon with Socrate in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>The
        Phaedrus</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as a<span
       >&nbsp;</span><em>pharmakon,</em><span>&nbsp;</span>gives
      to the mind and the spirit a power of potentially infinite accumulation of
      the experience that one’s can reminds and transmits. This technique of
      ideogrammatic writing will be progressively augmented in capacity through
      other technical developments: the paper will give the book, the press will
      ease their production, analogical writing through the mechanical capture
      of the sensible will give the phonography and photography, computing will
      give the numeric writing and the quasi-instant transmission and treatment
      of information.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      mechanization and industrialization of writing is constitutive of
      psychotechnologies that contribute at an industrial scale to shape the
      metastabilized milieu in which we transindividuate, in which we
      collectively and individually become who we are. In that regard, the major
      critique of Stiegler is that this overdetermination of who we become,
      giving a potential power of control to those who design, use or –
      regarding states institutions – regulate those technology, isn’t thought
      as such by political representatives, a lack of understanding resulting,
      very schematically, in two political trends, technophiles and technophobes
      – the first tending to support the idea of a positive correlation between
      technical progress and human progress, the other supporting the opposed
      correlation – when the “correct” approach would have been to analyze how
      technique, psychic and collective individuals compose together in a
      pharmacologic understanding of techniques, that is, after Simondon, an
      understanding of techniques as a bipolarized field of possibilities
      (Stiegler 2012a), which are articulated with social and nervous systems to
      form what Stiegler describes as a general organology, encompassing “the
      total human fact” (Stiegler 2006b, chap.28). Misunderstood and
      misregulated, those psychotechnologies produce what Stiegler’s names
      “telecracy” rather than democracy (Stiegler 2010c).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In
      this context, thinking the ethical character in the use of a given
      technique is thinking the forces it exercises in the general organology,
      and how it contributes to its metastabilization. Psychotechnologies are
      thus not bad as such but depend on the use and purpose they serve: they
      highly contributed to the human extension of possibilities, including both
      the possibility of totalitarian propaganda and Bernays Public Relations.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>Our
        wants and values are influenced not only by marketers, but also by
        family, peer groups, religion, ethnic background and education. If
        modern societies, wherever they exist, are highly materialistic, these
        values arose out of basic socialization processes that go much deeper
        than business and mass media could produce alone.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Kotler
        et al. 2005, p.177)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Kotler’s
      marketing manual is not wrong when saying that marketing doesn’t produce
      the value system but he seems to ignore or deny the higher than ever
      strength of marketing in its capacity to take control of
      psychotechnologies and their associated power upon individuation
      processes. The era of psychotechnologies overthrow the era of the human
      history opened by psychotechniques, including nootechniques – from<span>&nbsp;</span><em>noùs</em>,
      the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>esprit</em><span>&nbsp;</span>–
      that are not only techniques on the esprit but techniques from the esprit,
      intellectual and spiritual techniques, such as books in the context of the
      Enlightments (Stiegler 2008c, p.37; Ars Industrialis 2009) or the Internet
      in its intellectually empowering aspect.</p>

    <h3>2.3.4Formation
      and capture of attention and the capacity of care</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      formation of the attention that produce psychotechniques and especially
      the book, produced monotheisms, the philosophy and sciences:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>In
        another way, the capture of attention isn’t a flaw of our time:
        capturing attention, it’s forming it. Reciprocally, forming attention,
        it’s capturing it – what every teacher knows from experience. The
        formation of an attention – what Moses Mendelssohn, answering to the
        question of what is the<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>Aufklärung</span><em>,
        names the<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>Bildung</span><em><span

        – is a fundamental condition of any human society, that is to say of any
        individuation process because of being<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>at
        the same time</span><em><span>&nbsp;</span>psychic
        and collective: because of the formation of attention being a skill
        indissociably psychic and social, this formation is also the formation
        of what Simondon calls the transindividual”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Stiegler
        2008c, pp.37–38)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      word<span>&nbsp;</span><em>attention</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>from the Latin<span>&nbsp;</span><em>attendere</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>keeps in French and English
      its double meaning as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to
        take care</em>, paying attention (Stiegler 2012b). This capacity of
      attention that is the “mental faculty of concentrating on an object” and
      the “social faculty of taking care of this object” (Stiegler 2008d) is the
      result of an education:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<span>The
        formation of the attention through its social capture</span><em>, what
        is called the<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>education</span><em>,
        is the way psychic individuals not only co-individuate themselves, but
        transindividuate – including at the unconscious level”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Stiegler
        2008c, pp.39–40)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      capacity of attention, as an articulation of psychic primary retentions
      with psychic and collective secondary retentions overdetermined by
      tertiary retentions, differs, because of this overdetermination, from a
      society to another in accordance with the technical, social and psychic
      organology. In that regards, culture could be defined as the transmission
      of collective secondary retentions determining a specific capacity of
      attention (Stiegler 2008c, p.39). This transindividual<span>&nbsp;</span><em>symbolic</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>milieu that is culture is the
      place of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>savoirs</em>:<span
       >&nbsp;</span><em>savoir-vivre</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>savoir-faire<span
         >&nbsp;</span></em>[know-how],<span>&nbsp;</span><em>savoir-noétique</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>[from<span>&nbsp;</span><em>noùs</em>,
      noetic, theoretical knowledge] that are<span>&nbsp;</span><em>attentional
        forms of knowledge</em><span>&nbsp;</span>resulting
      from an education (Stiegler 2012b, p.2) and organizing the system of
      “taking care” in a society.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>Attention
        is also the name of civility as it is founded on<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>philia
        [</span><span>love in its large understanding, the socialized desire]</span><em>,
        that is, on socialised libidinal energy. This is why the destruction of
        attention is both the destruction of the psychical apparatus and the
        destruction of the social apparatus (formed by collective individuation)
        to the extent that the later constitutes<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>[a]</span><em><span

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>2.4.1Consumerism
      as the opposite of the care</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In
      the Deleuzian description of the society of control, “the goal is not
      anymore to form and exploit producers but to control consumer’s behavior”
      through the development of psychotechnologies that are “attention control
      apparatuses”, which destroy attention, and responsibility with it
      (Stiegler 2010a). The scheme that emerges here is the industrial
      exploitation of the libidinal energy, canalized through attention capture
      and symbolic systems, to form the raw material of marketing that is
      motivation as an input for the economic activity in a society that used to
      be based on the belief that there is a strong correlative relation between
      consumption and “the Pursuit of Happiness” success. But this system is
      highly entropic in the sense that this attempt to exploit this newly
      discovered, in the 1950s, input couldn’t be endlessly practiced without
      caring of the limits and renewability of the resource. A manifest symptom
      of this limit is the huge movement of disbelief regarding this consumerist
      correlation with happiness:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>According
        to surveys conducted recently by the sociologist Juliet Schor, 81% of
        Americans estimate that their country is too centered on consumption and
        almost 90% of them consider that it is too materialistic.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Stiegler
        2008d)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span>The
        system of care, previously described as the capacity of attention and
        the psychic and collective constitution of savoirs articulated in a
        collective individual that is a culture, has been hugely impacted by
        consumerism value system and marketing co-development. The science of
        motivation leading to the canalization and synchronization of motivation
        in a system aiming analogy with the scientific management of the
        factory, without the possibility of biopower but offset with an
        intensive research of psychopower, result in a process of
        proletarization – understood as the loss of savoir – of the consumer:</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>For
        if it is true that industrialisation in general is the generalisation of
        a mnemotechnological reproducibility of the motor behaviour of
        producers, hyperindustrialisation is the generalisation of a
        mnemotechnological reproducibility of the motor behaviour of consumers.
        Just as the producer – whose gesture is reproduced, and whose know-how
        passes into the machine, which turns him or her into what is called a
        proletarian –, the consumer is divested of his savoir-vivre, his
        know-how-to-live-well, and<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>[find
        himself]</span><em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
        the same stroke desindividuated: he is nothing more than an instance of
        purchasing power, which is to say of heedless consumerism, which
        destroys the world heedlessly.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Stiegler
        2009, sec.2)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      process is easily thinkable for one’s who already considered the marketing
      way of thinking: there is a product; it should be sold in order to
      maximize profit – that is to say until infinity if the marginal cost stays
      always lower than the selling price. This simple assertion, that has
      nothing exceptional for a marketing course, is a denial of the psychic and
      collective production of the libidinal energy production system that is a
      libidinal economy; an assertion opposed to the very principle of an
      economy that is originally to economize resources, to take care of them,
      and not to grow infinitely as underlined by Pierre Rabhi – a defender of
      de-growth, hence in contradiction with Stiegler but with a comparable
      leaning to highlight the undermining of the care value and the urge to
      make it central.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While
      supply chain management has to deal with the economy of natural resources,
      marketing deals with the economy – that would mean in a correct
      understanding of the term “economy”, a care; approach that we will try to
      elaborate regarding marketing later – of two resources: attention and
      desire. The attention is what the “attention economy” doesn’t economize
      but rather wastes while trying to immoderately capture it with all the
      available means. The desire is what the science of motivation destroys
      while trying to divert it from it social function in order to turn it as
      an input of business.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      society of services in which marketing aims to push a service as a
      substitute to every savoirs-vivre in order to explore new possibilities of
      profit, destroys when successful those savoirs-vivre, which let consumers
      “off the hook of their own existences” (Stiegler 2008d).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>When
        everything becomes a service, transindividuation is completely
        short-circuited by marketing and advertising. Public life is, then,
        destroyed: psychic and collective individuation becomes collective
        disindividuation”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Stiegler
        2006b)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      proletarization process is the very hard point of Stiegler’s critiques and
      the major difficulty that is encountered when trying to think an ethical
      marketing: if the service industries went beyond the limits, what are
      those limits and how to implement such a critique in business when it
      seems to aim major parts of the economy from for instance prepared meals
      to children entertainment?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>The
        more we delegate the execution of series of small tasks that make up the
        warp and woof of our lives to the apparatuses and services of modern
        industry, the more vain we become: the more we lose not only our
        know-how but our know-how-to-live-well: the only thing left for us is to
        consume blindly, a kind of impotence, without these saveurs (savours)
        that only savoir – from sapere – which is knowledge, can provide. We
        become impotent if not obsolete – if it is true that knowledge is what
        empowers humanity.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Stiegler

    <h3>2.4.2Marketing
      use of psychotechnologies through the highly strategic cultural and
      program industries</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>2.4.2.1The
      use of psychotechnologies by marketing toward a minor state of minds</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      development of psychotechnologies based on analogic writing that are
      radio, cinema and television, opening the era of cultural industries and,
      with radio and even more with television, of program industries, has been
      rapidly exploited by marketing for their high power of influence upon the
      formation of symbolically charged psychic and collective secondary
      retentions. Cinema’s exceptional potential of both attention capture and
      influence upon the symbolic milieu, its capacity to influence the psychic
      process of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>identification</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>and thus upon the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>ideal-of-the-self</em>,
      rapidly made it a strategic media for the production of motivation:
      cigarettes, cars, individual housing, the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>American
        Way of Life</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as a
      whole were highly promoted since the very first decades of the cinema
      (Stiegler 2010a). Television intensifies this psychopower, this
      short-circuit of the identification process by making this influence
      potentially permanent and recurrent: the program industry come to
      concurrence the program institution that is school, which is the
      institution in charge of forming and capturing attention and produce the
      education, that is the use of psychotechniques for the formation of a
      system of care. Television also short-circuit the formation of the
      attention by another fundamental institution that is family, responsible
      of the generational transmission of knowledge and of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>technique-of-the-self</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>(Stiegler 2008b).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Regarding
      television and marketing relations, a sentence, pronounced by a
      professional of psychotechnologies the former director of TF1, the first
      French TV channel, has been especially important in France:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>There
        are many ways to speak about TV, but in a business perspective, let's be
        realistic: at the basis, TF1's job is helping Coca-Cola, for example, to
        sell its product. What we sell to Coca-Cola is available human brain
        time.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Les
        associés d’EIM 2004)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      sentence was pronounced few years after the beginning of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Real-TV</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>shows in France, which have
      two major trends opened to criticism: the stimulation of drives rather
      than desire and the continuation in the liquidation of the Super-Ego for
      the profit of marketing.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Psychotechnologies
      open a new field for industrialization that is the symbolic
      industrialization: the symbolic milieu is what “organize the daily life in
      all its details” and forms “every nook and cranny” of our souls whatever
      how intimate or unconscious, what services industries and program
      industries took over and reduce to calculation, leading to
      desymbolisation, regression toward drives and herd instinct (Stiegler
      2008b, pp.85–86). Extensively analyzed by Stiegler in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Telecracy
        against democracy</em>, this capacity of television to constitute
      intermittent artificial masses of individuals, sharing most of natural
      masses characteristics that is, after Freud analyses of masses, the
      feeling of responsibility disappearance, the mental contagion and the loss
      of goodwill through the identification to a common object, eventually an
      object or a leader (Stiegler 2008b, p.131). Indeed, being unidirectional
      psychotechnologies, that is technologies where the receiver of a message
      can’t become the transmitter and thus can’t participate to the
      transindividuation: he is stuck in a state of permanent minority, always
      listening and never in position to answer; he is never asked to do the
      psychic long-circuit that is the one of the critique. This incapacity to
      participate in the transformation of the symbolic milieu can’t produce the
      individuation normally produced by any social relation but the one of
      unidirectional communication, which is thus not a communication but the
      propagation of a message, of a dogma closed to critiques, of a propaganda
      intended to the mass of minor minds, and so, maintained in this minor
      state of mind, that is in their irresponsibility. For Stiegler, this
      pattern constitute a break to the project of the Enlightments, namely that
      every individual was potentially able to intellectually raise itself up,
      which was the project of the scholar system building between the end of
      the nineteenth and the twentieth century, aiming to reinforce one’s
      capacities to make the intelligence, the reason dominate in its inner
      battle between stupidity [approximate translation of the French<span>&nbsp;</span><em>bêtise</em>,
      less an insult in Stiegler’s lexic than the polarity opposed to
      intelligence in the spiritual milieu] and intelligence (Stiegler 2008c,
      pp.59–70): in this battle, the inattentive, careless practice of marketing
      largely pushs for stupidity.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>2.4.2.2Primary
      and secondary identification short-circuit</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      identification process, the process creating an<span>&nbsp;</span><em>ideal-of-the-self</em>,
      i.e. the idealization of one’s vision of its present and future self, what
      he think he tend to be and wants to become, constitutive of the Ego, is
      divided in the Freudian theory in two phases between the primary
      identification and the secondary identification. The primary
      identification is the identification to the first circle of the baby’s
      social life that is usually the family and especially the parents.
      According to Freud, this phase constitute an indelible trace in the
      constitution of the ideal-of-the-self. Then there is the secondary
      identification that is identification to other individuals, which will
      also influence the ideal-of-the-self. But in this process, the
      contradictory influences are solved by the primary identification, playing
      the role of a “psychic compass” for the ideal-of-the-self, thus ensuring
      its coherence (Stiegler 2008b, p.102). This identification process of the
      always becoming Ego has been conceptualized has an important source of
      potential motivation to buy, since the science of motivation directly
      addressed the unconscious. The identification process became thus a major
      stake for marketing, given that the resulting Ego constitute the</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>contact
        of savoir with the outside world as a perception/consciousness system,
        from which it is a living savoir as the apparatus collecting the primary
        retentions and integrating them to the secondary retentions, and by
        doing so, transforming and enriching this heritage with new experience
        on this subject.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Stiegler
        2008c, p.31)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Being
      the object of an identification process gives thus a power of influence
      upon the Ego that is upon the psychic apparatus articulated on secondary
      retentions. Marketing being the client of televisions buys attention and
      secondary identification to its marks and products, and by doing so
      through the use of psychotechnologies designed for drive-stimulation and
      addiction-stimulation, destroys attention and destroys the
      intergenerational identification process:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>This
        destruction<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>[of
        the attention]<span>&nbsp;</span></span><em>proceeds
        in this way because attention is what organizes and is organized by
        retentions and protentions, but today these are massively and
        incessantly controlled by the retentional and protentional processes of
        television. From the childhood stage of primary identification to the
        secondary identifications of the adult, these processes seek to
        substitute the secondary collective retentions elaborated by the process
        of transindividuation (which is nothing other than the vital process of
        psychic and collective individuation), with secondary collective
        retentions entirely fabricated according to the results of market
        studies and prescriptive marketing techniques, as much as by the
        specifications of designers, stylists, developers and ergonomists,
        together realizing the accelerated socialization of technological
        innovation.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Stiegler
        2006b)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      accelerated socialization of technological innovation also accelerate the
      proletarization process as the technical milieu being permanently
      changing, the possibilities to psychically stabilize oneself knowledge is
      an unprecedented rush against the obsolescence of the psychical
      individuation that is the psychic interior in relation with the exterior
      world.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Minors
      maintained minors doesn’t properly individuate themselves but rather
      desindividuate as an artificial mass of hypersynchronized minds unable to
      maintain a sane primary narcissism i.e. a self-esteem normally resulting
      of a sane primary identification process, they are slowed down if not
      stopped in their construction of the Ego as a singularity that is an
      understanding of the self as someone different from the mass (Stiegler
      2008b).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>2.4.3Marketing
      versus the intergenerational transmission of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>savoir</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>and the constitution of a
      Super-Ego</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      evolution of familial functioning and the diminution of intra-familial
      relations with a greater autonomy, a progressive disappearance of this
      “interior” led to influence directly the primary identification, orienting
      the psychic compass toward the value system promoted by television and its
      client that is marketing, which in the consumerist inattentive culture, is
      open to immoderate outlooks until profits justify it. This direct attack
      upon the Super-Ego reinforces a downfall of responsibilities and authority
      systems on which were structured previous system of care.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>Children,
        adolescents and parents are seriously unbalanced in their relations,
        that is, in their being. The passage from the psychic to the collective
        begins with this relation, which is not therefore secondary but
        primordial, weaved into the primary identification whereby the child,
        like his parents, is in a transductive relation with his familiars.
        Currently, this relation is seriously perturbed by industrial temporal
        objects capturing and diverting attention, profoundly modifying the play
        of retentions and protentions, and above all producing secondary
        collective retentions which short-circuit the work of transmission
        between generations, work which is the only possibility of dialogue,
        including and above all through the modes of opposition and provocation”<span
         >&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Stiegler 2008d,
        sec.29).</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      1968 struggles in Western societies pushing for the opening of those
      “interiors” that used to constitute institutionalized form of the
      Super-Ego, in what Marcuse defended as an attempt to free the pleasure
      principle of the reality principle to reach of golden of libido through
      the liberation of “instincts”:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>This
        discourse<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>[of
        Marcuse]</span><em><span>&nbsp;</span>is
        blind to the fact that pleasure, taking shape in a confrontation with
        reality, derives from a composition of tendencies rather than their
        opposition – the question being the binding or linkage of these
        tendencies by desire, and their degeneration leading to the reign of the
        drives, i.e., to spiritual misery</em><span>.” (Stiegler 2006a)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      countercultural trend developing during the 1960s-1970s pushing for the
      “liberation of instincts”, aiming to dismantle society taboo, with the
      benediction of numerous intellectuals and large parts of the population
      especially the youth, hugely benefited to marketing by opening wide the
      doors to the systematic exploitation of regressive pulsions i.e. to the
      spiritual misery (Stiegler 2006a) from which the most vivid example is the<span
       >&nbsp;</span><em>Trash TV.<span>&nbsp;</span></em>Television
      aiming the attention capture to sell it to marketing is strongly incited
      to prefer regressive and transgressive contents, in which drives find an
      archaic object of expression. In that regard, the history of MTV from
      rebel, that is transgressive, to product placement is a first-quality
      illustration:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>Advertisers
        looked at MTV and knew they were getting a viewing environment in which
        it made less and less sense to separate selling from entertainment and
        consumption from enjoyment. MTV’s programming amounted to almost a
        complete context of selling.”</em><span><span>&nbsp;</span>(Pettegrew
        1992)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      hijacking of the 1960s counterculture by marketing is also easily
      observable in the exploition of the aspiration for individualized
      production rather than the formerly standardized consumption inherited
      from fordism (Floris &amp; Ledun 2005). The transformation of the system
      toward a greater valuation of the expression of the self, of every
      singularity and its singular potential, was adopted and its tremendous
      energy extensively used to make the marketing paradigm evolve in parallel
      to the development of design as a major pillar to the product development.
      Through this updated marketing paradigm, every consumer would find the
      product appropriated to the expression of its inner personality:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Think
        different!</em><span>&nbsp;</span>The
      power of products as a social marker reaches a new high and advertisement
      find a new motto, the new expression of its essential mission in its
      attempt to make the symbolic milieu the ally of sells: being cool (Frank
      1998).</p>

      years later, the summit of design that is Apple is able to satisfy
      hundreds of millions of those different, unique, singular customers – but
      in fact hypersynchronized individual in their diverted identification
      process and canalized libidinal energy – with a single product.</p>

    <h4>2.4.4.1Destruction
      of the attention and hypersynchronization of the object of attention</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span>The
        capture of attention by psychotechnologies, financed by marketing for
        motivation production purposes, reaches a new high with the omnipresence
        of screens and digital social networks:</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>Since
        people are spending more time away from home, marketers are spending
        more money on bringing TV to you: in shopping malls and in grocery
        stores</em><span><span>&nbsp;</span>[…]</span><em><span
         >&nbsp;</span>and of course, advertising
        reaches people on computers and movie screens.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Johnson
        2009)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span>Far
        from returning the trend and to produce a new capacity of attention as
        multidirectional psychotechnologies, digital social networks and the
        Internet at large constitute a new playground for advertisers, pushing
        this revolutionary technology allowing peers to connect worldwide toward
        an Internet Marketing contest mainly through Search Engine Optimization
        (SEO) techniques, that is the articulation of variably fair ruses – the
        fairness distinguishing<span>&nbsp;</span></span><em>whitehat</em><span><span
         >&nbsp;</span>from<span>&nbsp;</span></span><em>blackhat</em><span><span
         >&nbsp;</span>SEO practitioners – to,
        schematically, appear first on Google search engine for the keyword that
        capture enough traffic to sell proportional amount of attention to
        advertisers. Regarding facebook, the biggest digital social network at
        the time this paper is written, the problem of how to monetize this
        unprecedented amount of attention gathered in a place is still the
        subject of controversial debate illustrated by the doubts around
        Facebook IPO: if it already represent a “$3 billion-a-year advertising
        business” there are serious doubts around advertisers “money's worth”
        (Vranica &amp; Raice 2012). The efficiency of such diluted ads is
        clearly more difficult to measure and to make profitable than at “the
        golden age of television, [when] an ad on one of the big three [US]
        networks could reach 70 percent of the viewing audience” (Johnson 2009)
        and when the attention capacity was less diluted: the multi-tasking or
        permanent zapping is naming an era of great attention dilution.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In
      front of the hypersynchronizational trend created by program industries
      and advertisement at large, one’s might have hope that the decentralized
      network that is the internet would have annihilate such a trend, but far
      from being annihilate, the rush for clicks with a SEO purpose – with an
      extension of the optimization for social networks – tend to create what
      could be described as a decentralized hypersynchronization of contents –
      commonly called a<span>&nbsp;</span><em>buzz</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>– in such a way that a minor
      event such as a rumor of a bug on Facebook or an update of an Apple
      product, release the rush for attention between bloggers: by doing so,
      they hope to exploit the symbolic capital already constituted by those
      successful brands to catch a part of the attention pie. This movement of
      the treatment of news website relying on advertisment could illustratively
      be compared to the planetary accretion process: a lot of matter ends by
      the force of gravity to create a few giant objects around originally
      already big objects, surrounded by a few asteroids and the intersidereal
      void. This new layer in the field of attention capture that are ubiquitous
      laptop, smartphones, tabelts screens contribute to create new pathologies
      and attention disorders:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>The
        capture of attention by technological means is a global phenomenon
        (affecting all continents), a massive one (affecting all generations and
        all social strata) and totally new: the length of capture has now
        reached 6 hours a day in the USA, not to mention the phenomena of
        hyper-attention, to use the term of Katherine Hayles, which provoke a
        splitting of attention between several media simultaneously, and which
        motivate the Kaiser family foundation to modify its figures – increasing
        the average number of hours to 8 and a half per day for American
        adolescents. Humanity has never experienced such a phenomenon of
        synchronised and hyper-realist collective hallucination, and the
        consequences of these facts on psychical and collective individuation
        are as yet hardly theorized, although they are beginning to enter as
        objects of the study of psychopathology, or investigations in the human
        sciences, for example the case of the syndrome of cognitive saturation.”</em><span>(Stiegler
        2008a)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Attention,
      that is explicitly thought as a major resources through the works on the<span
       >&nbsp;</span><em>attention economy</em><span
       >&nbsp;</span>(Davenport &amp; Beck 2001)
      is suffering from a never previously experienced shortage, which is the
      first shortage leading to a crisis of the esprit life, the second one
      being the one created by the destruction of desire.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>2.4.4.2Libidinal
      energy exhaustion</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This
      regressive, drive-oriented marketing that emerged with the carte blanche
      of the baby-boomers counterculture, flatting the transgressive penchant of
      youth – penchant inherent to the psychic construction toward adulthood and
      majority but never exploited in such an industrial way before – constitute
      a short-circuit of the sublimation circuit, leading to the liquidation of
      the social energy that is desire. In that regard, marketing acts like a
      “parasite” of society, diverting the psychic energy that are drives in
      order to create buying motivation, acting like a free-rider on the psychic
      resources created through the long and “expensive” process of education
      produced by the social organization and structured by intergenerational
      relations. But even the free-rider doesn’t try to sink the ship he freely
      travels in: marketing careless behavior produce tremendous – while largely
      neglected – externalities. This short-circuit of sublimation, that is to
      say of the idealization process that is at the heart of civilization,
      divert the libidinal economy and result in an exhaustion of psychic and
      social resources, ending in a symbolic misery and produce disaffected
      individuals suffering a loss of the sense of the self. Indeed, the
      destruction of desire, and thus in the taste –<span>&nbsp;</span><em>la
        saveur</em><span>&nbsp;</span>– for life
      isn’t sustainable:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>The
        desire which balanced and linked<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>[drives]</span><em><span
         >&nbsp;</span>has disappeared. This is
        the moment when one passes from cheerful consumption, which believes in
        progress, to miserable consumption, where the consumer feels he
        regresses and suffers from it.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Stiegler
        2006b)</span></p>

    <h3>2.4.5Trans-individuation
      short-circuit, disaffected individuals, symbolic misery</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      originally liberating movement of consumerism, associated with the symbols
      of a society freeing itself from old social schemes, such as religion or
      the familial authority, ends in the other extreme that is a generalized
      nihilism, in which the market progressively conquered every field of
      existence, offering services and pushing them through massive
      unidirectional psychotechnologies-based advertisement campaigns, from how
      to distract children to how to meet love: “<em>there is an application for
        that</em>”.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>In
        hyperindustrial society, where everything becomes a service—that is,
        marketed relations and objects of marketing—life has been completely
        reduced to consumption, and the effects of psychic disindividuation
        completely rebound upon collective individuation<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>[…]</span><em><span
         >&nbsp;</span>Public life is, then,
        destroyed: psychic and collective individuation become collective
        disindividuation. There is no longer any</em><span>us</span><em>; there
        is only the<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>they</span><em>,
        and the collective, whether it be familial, political, professional,
        confessional, national, rational or universal, is no longer the bearer
        of any horizon: it appears totally void of content.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Stiegler
        2006b)</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Unable
      to take part to the transindividuation, the disaffected individual that is
      the individual suffering from an hypersolicitation of attention and an
      affective saturation is missing the opportunity to raise up itself in the
      symbolic milieu: paying for services saving him to take the intellectual
      long circuits that is the work of life knowledge development, the spoiled
      child’s system of meanings tend to turn toward more extreme ways of
      experience than those canned-life experiences, extreme ways that tend to
      be destructive. The disaffected individuals become indifferent</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>toward
        their parents and to everything around them, and provokes as well a
        generalized apathy supercharged with menace—of which the monstrous
        heroes of Gus Van Sant's<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>Elephant</span><em><span
         >&nbsp;</span>are the symbols.<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>[…]</span><em><span
         >&nbsp;</span>There are human wastelands
        like there are industrial wastelands. Such is the redoubtable question
        of the industrial ecology of the spirit.”<span>&nbsp;</span></em><span>(Stiegler
